# ChatGPT-powered-Discord-chatbot
This project is a ChatGPT-powered Discord chatbot designed to run entirely in Google Colab, eliminating the need for local setup or hosting. The bot leverages the Discord API to connect to a server and listen for messages, and the OpenAI API to generate intelligent, conversational responses.
